text = "Dear Security Demon 696,

Thank you for your outstanding contributions to the organisation. You have single handedly fended off the mortals whilst we eliminated all knowledge of the maps from the mortal civilisations. Unfortunately, coming into close contact with Shrine 1 for such an extended period would be considered a security breach if we were to allow you to leave.

Companion Cat 362 will now eliminate you. Thank you for your service.

Kind regards,
Head Office"
